Hello! I'm a Computer Science student at The Ohio State University.

I am very interested in how Machine Learning interacts with our world and love learning about it!
My research has focused on developing trustworthy machine learning. There are many pillars underlying the goal of trustworthy ML: fairness, security, explainability, robustness, and responsibility. Improving on these core principles will be crucial for creating systems that benefit the society they are deployed in.
