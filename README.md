Hello! I'm a Computer Science student at The Ohio State University.

I am very interested in how Machine Learning interacts with our world and love learning about it!

I have experience coding in Python, Java, C, C++, and MATLAB.
I'm interested in many subsets of machine learning such as computer vision, reinforcement learning, and fairness, and how they can be applied to solve new problems.
